Welcome! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying Physics and Mathematics.

I am broadly interested in high energy and condensed matter physics, and include quantum many-body simulations, topological field theories, and critical phenomena. During my undergraduate degree, I was fortunate enough to work on a variety of research projects, which you can read more about in [projects](/projects).

You can reach out to me via email at: a [dot] chugh [at] mail [dot] utoronto [dot] ca
