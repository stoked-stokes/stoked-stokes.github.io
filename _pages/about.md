Welcome! I'm a first year master's student at McGill University, working in the condensed matter theory group. I am supervised by <a href='https://pbtami.wixsite.com/mysite-1'>Prof. Tami Pereg-Barnea</a>.

I am broadly interested in topological systems, superconductivity, novel phases of magnetism, and critical phenomena. During my undergraduate degree, I was fortunate enough to work on a variety of research projects, which you can read more about in [projects](/projects).

You can reach out to me via email at: aditya [dot] chugh [at] mail [dot] mcgill [dot] ca
